    <h1>Assignment 2.2 - Building a Web Page Exercise - Part 2</h1>
    <h2>A little bit of Patrice</h2>
    <p class="intro"> I was raised in a French village called St-Florent located on the seashore with a beautiful marina. It's located on a french island in the mediterranean sea. It 'a a very touristic region when summer comes.</p>
    <p><span class="sentence">I had a very happy childhood, my parents are the best and spoiled my brother and me, which is nice but not the best to evolve later in life.</span> My Dad is a doctor and my mother raised us. My brother later moved to London where he lives with his girlfriend.</p>
    <p>My favorite hobby is tweaking my home cinema. I use a very good freeware named REW and a mic to make measurements and correct the room acoustics. The results are fantastic.</p>
    <p>I moved to the US 10 years ago and I live in Texas with my husband and his two adult kids. I decided to change of career as I was a nurse in France, I switched to software development  </p>
